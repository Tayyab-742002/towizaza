# Performance Optimizations for Towizaza Website

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the loading speed, responsiveness, and user experience of the Towizaza music website.

## Asset Optimization

### Image Optimization

1. **Next.js Image Component**

   - Replaced standard `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` component
   - Added automatic responsive sizing, WebP/AVIF format conversion
   - Implemented lazy loading with proper width/height to prevent layout shifts

2. **LazyImage Component**

   - Created a custom `LazyImage` component that:
     - Uses blur placeholders for faster perceived loading
     - Implements progressive loading with fade-in animations
     - Handles Sanity CMS image sources automatically

3. **Responsive Image Sizing**
   - Defined optimal image sizes for different viewport widths
   - Added device-specific quality settings (lower on mobile, higher on desktop)
   - Configured proper cache headers for images

### Audio Optimization

1. **Adaptive Audio Quality**

   - Implemented data saver mode for mobile connections
   - Added quality detection based on connection type
   - Created 3-tier quality options: low (96kbps), medium (192kbps), high (320kbps)

2. **Audio Preloading**

   - Added preloading for the next track in the queue
   - Implemented a preload link API for audio resources
   - Disabled preloading when in data saver mode

3. **Streaming Optimizations**
   - Added query parameters for CDN optimization
   - Improved error handling and fallbacks for audio loading
   - Added network-aware playback adjustments

## Code Splitting

1. **Dynamic Imports**

   - Implemented lazy loading for non-critical components
   - Added code splitting for the music player and shopping cart
   - Created dynamic imports for section components on the home page

2. **Component-Level Code Splitting**

   - Separated mobile player from desktop player implementation
   - Split large component logic into smaller, focused pieces
   - Used React.lazy and Suspense for component loading

3. **Route-Based Splitting**
   - Implemented per-route code splitting
   - Added loading states during component hydration
   - Created fallback UI for loading sections

## Lazy Loading

1. **Component Lazy Loading**

   - Implemented progressive loading of page sections
   - Added intersection observer-based loading for off-screen content
   - Created placeholder components while content loads

2. **Media Lazy Loading**

   - Added loading="lazy" attribute to all images
   - Implemented IntersectionObserver for media elements
   - Added blur-up technique for images

3. **Data Fetching Optimizations**
   - Implemented pagination and infinite scrolling for large data sets
   - Added priority loading for above-the-fold content
   - Created fallback data for faster initial load

## Performance Configuration

1. **Centralized Settings**

   - Created a performance configuration file
   - Added capability detection for device and connection
   - Implemented adaptive settings based on device capabilities

2. **Next.js Configuration**

   - Optimized webpack configuration
   - Added proper caching headers
   - Disabled source maps in production

3. **Browser Hints**
   - Added preconnect and dns-prefetch for critical domains
   - Implemented resource hints for key pages
   - Added preload for critical assets

## Testing and Monitoring

To ensure these optimizations are effective, regularly:

1. Run Lighthouse performance audits in Chrome DevTools
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
3. Test loading on various devices and connection speeds
4. Check network waterfall charts for loading sequence

## Future Optimizations

1. Implement HTTP/2 Server Push for critical assets
2. Add service worker for offline functionality
3. Further optimize initial JavaScript bundle size
4. Implement server-side rendering for more components
